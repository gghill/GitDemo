```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
```

This is a demonstration script to show how a script can be converted to
an R project and then a Git repository to be shared.

## Why git??

**Version control!** 

This approach improves security and reproducibility.

## Setting up Git on your computer

### Step Zero

Install git and create a github profile online.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
system2(command = 'git', stdout = TRUE)
```
If your computer doesn't have git installed, this command should prompt an install.

After that, you can set up the connection to your github profile

```{r git setup, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.com")
# fill in your github username and associated email above
git_vaccinate()
create_github_token()
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

Then we are set to load the library and get a status report

```{r sitrep, echo=TRUE}
library(usethis)
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

## Getting your code ready for github

### Create an R project

This is a useful structure to organize multiple scripts within a project on its own, but is also the base unit of a git repository.

![File > New Project > Existing Directory](https://codehorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GitHubBlog3-705x509.png)

Or via command line:
```{r proj init, eval=FALSE}
create_project(path = "../GitDemo", open = TRUE, rstudio = TRUE)
```

### Initialize git

Then all that is left to do is initialize git while in our directory with the R project.

```{r initialize, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
system2(command = "git init", stdout = TRUE)
```

Restart R Studio, if it worked you should have a .Rproj file in your directory and a Git tab in R Studio.

Next we **commit**, but don't push! This can be done via command line (below, for reference), but I always do it manually.

```{r commit, eval = FALSE}
system2(command = "git add .", stdout = TRUE)
system2(command = 'git commit -m "Initial commit"', stdout = TRUE)
```

Now we move to setting up the github side, creating a new repo and using the presets for an existing directory.

github will give us some code which we need to run in the terminal *not* console

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/example_project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Done!

Now you can code, commit, and push to keep an online version up to date and visible to collaborators.

Other functions:

* README
* gitignore
* Fork
* Branch
  + model development
* Pull
* Organizations!
